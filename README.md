You can change the map dimensions by clicking the button in the bottom left corner next to the map dimensions.

IMPORTANT: when changing the map size, it will always cut/add tiles on **all sides** of the map. So if you're shrinking the map, consider that you may lose tiles. Map size changes CANNOT be undone, so be cautious with that.

### Map testing

Map testing is only available by implementing the RealmEditorLib into your pserver's client, and making the necessary changes, there's not an easy way to do this right now so... if you know, you know. You can give it a try and follow these changes I made to the betterSkillys client to implement the map editor, it's an older version but the changes required are almost identical, only need to replace Event.CONNECT with RealmEditorTestEvent.TEST_CONNECT. ðŸ«¡

### Property filter
Click the arrow to the left of the right-side panel (elements panel) to open the property filter list.

Write the name of the property and the desired value for it (leave blank for *true*).
Press "Add" to add it to the list.

The elements panel will update based on the filter list. Elements that don't match every property in the filter list will not show in the panel.
